- 👋 Hi, I’m @dhaber-asm
- 👀 I’m interested in schematron, QuickFixes, and other XML/XSLT tools and technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to break as many ASM production processes as possible to make them more streamlined.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of interesting fusion of xml production of scientific content and various tools to make publication faster and less onerous.
